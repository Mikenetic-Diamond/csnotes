This is a place to store my notes for IB CS 2025

jill!  Look Over Here!
Today we learned how to kill a banana
bro why can't my github work?
**Network, Logic, Binary, and Computer Organization** units, structured to align with the original content and enhanced with citations from the provided knowledge bases:
here's the notes:
---

### **1. Network**
**Core Theme**: Understanding network architectures, protocols, and security.  
**Key Concepts**:
1. **Network Types & Topologies**
    - **LAN** (Local Area Network) vs. **WAN** (Wide Area Network): Coverage ranges (e.g., LAN spans a building, WAN connects cities).
    - Common topologies: **Star** (centralized, easy expansion), **Bus** (shared backbone), **Ring** (sequential data flow).

2. **Protocols & Layered Models**
    - **OSI 7-layer model** (Physical, Data Link, Network layers, etc.) vs. **TCP/IP 4-layer stack** (Application, Transport, Internet, Link layers).
    - Key protocols: **HTTP** (web), **FTP** (file transfer), **SMTP** (email).

3. **Security & Threats**
    - **Firewalls** (filter traffic) and **SSL/TLS** (encrypt data).
    - Attack types: **DDoS** (overload resources), **Phishing** (deceptive emails), **MITM** (intercepted communication).

**Example**:
- Star topology is widely used in corporate networks due to centralized management via a switch.

### **2. Logic**
**Core Theme**: Boolean logic and circuit design.  
**Key Concepts**:
1. **Boolean Algebra**
    - Operators: **AND**, **OR**, **NOT** (truth tables define outputs).
    - **De Morgan’s Laws**: Simplify expressions (e.g., ¬(A ∧ B) ≡ ¬A ∨ ¬B).

2. **Logic Gates & Circuits**
    - **Combinational circuits** (e.g., adders) vs. **sequential circuits** (e.g., flip-flops with memory).
    - Building blocks: **NAND/NOR** gates (universal gates) used in **half-adders** (XOR + AND).

3. **Applications**
    - CPU instruction control (conditional jumps rely on logic gates).
    - **Karnaugh Maps** optimize digital circuit designs.

**Example**:
- A half-adder computes binary addition (e.g., 1+1=10 in binary).

---

### **3. Binary**
**Core Theme**: Binary representation and operations.  
**Key Concepts**:
1. **Number Systems**
    - Conversions: **Binary ↔ Decimal ↔ Hexadecimal** (e.g., 1011₂ = 11₁₀ = B₁₆).
    - **Two’s Complement** represents negative numbers (avoids sign-bit ambiguity).

2. **Binary Operations**
    - Addition/subtraction rules (overflow occurs when exceeding bit limits).
    - Bit shifts: Left (×2), Right (÷2).

3. **Data Storage**
    - **ASCII** (7-bit) vs. **Unicode** (multi-language support, e.g., UTF-8).
    - Images: **Pixels** (resolution) and **color depth** (24-bit RGB = 16.7 million colors).

**Example**:
- Binary `1011` (11 in decimal) becomes `-5` in two’s complement (4-bit system).

---

### **4. Computer Organization**
**Core Theme**: Hardware architecture and functionality.  
**Key Concepts**:
1. **Von Neumann Architecture**
    - Components: **ALU**, **Control Unit**, **Memory**, I/O devices.
    - **Stored Program Concept**: Instructions/data stored in memory.

2. **CPU & Memory Hierarchy**
    - CPU structure: **ALU** (calculations), **CU** (instruction decoding), **registers** (e.g., Program Counter).
    - Hierarchy: Registers → Cache → RAM/ROM → Secondary Storage (speed vs. capacity trade-off).

3. **Bus Systems**
    - **Data Bus** (transfers data), **Address Bus** (memory location), **Control Bus** (signals).
    - Bus width (e.g., 64-bit improves data throughput).

**Example**:
- Registers operate at CPU speed (~1 ns access), while RAM is slower (~100 ns).
